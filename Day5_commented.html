<p>Today we continued analyzing Simon Data starting where Homework 4 left
off. We added absolute outlier marking, and fixed how we marked
relative outliers (marking them separately for correct and other
trials). We then summarized the data using <code>ddply</code> and learned about
how to use the <code>reshape</code> package to flexibly reshape data.

<h4 id="sec-1.2.1"><span class="section-number-4">1.2.1</span> Marking absolute outliers &amp; Relative Outliers </h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1.2.1">

<p>We started off by marking relative outliers, those trials which lie
outside of 2.5 SD above and below each participant's mean. We
typically also remove outliers that fall below 200ms (because such a
fast response in a language experiment is likely due to an
anticipatory button press) and above a certain threshold that might
indicate that the subject was not paying attention (e.g., 2000 ms).
</p>
<p>
First, we should establish the high and low cutoff. This should be
done near the beginning of the script after loading libraries. This
allows people reading your code to see that you've established some
constant values that you will use later on.
</p>



<pre class="example">absolute_outlier_high_cut = 2000
absolute_outlier_low_cut = 200
</pre>




<p>
Next, we now will add an additional level to the accuracy column of
your dataset. This allows you to keep track of the number of relative
and absolute outliers independently. We'll change out level-naming line to the following.
</p>



<pre class="example">levels(data$Stimulus.ACC) = c("incorrect", "correct", "ab_outliers", "rel_outliers")
</pre>




<p>
Now we actually mark absolute outlier trials. We typically do this
directly before marking relative outliers. Compared to marking
relative outliers, marking absolute outliers is easy, because you're
using two static cutoffs, so no plying is necessary.
</p>



<pre class="example">##Identify absolute outliers before relative outliers.
data$Stimulus.ACC[data$Stimulus.RT &gt; absolute_outlier_high_cut |
data$Stimulus.RT &lt; absolute_outlier_low_cut] = "ab_outliers"
</pre>




<p>
Alright, so now we have a set of correct trials, incorrect trials, and
abs<sub>outlier</sub> trials. Next we'll calculate the relative outlier trials
with a couple of tiny changes over last time. Before, we calculated
relative outliers only by subject. However, this means that both
correct trials and incorrect trials are included in this
analysis. Because incorrect trials tend to be slower and because we're
often not concerned about RTs for incorrect trials, we should leave
them out of the relative outlier calculation. Additionally, we'll want
to leave out any trials that we've just marked as absolute outliers.
To do this, we can have <code>ddply()</code> split our data by subject and
additionally by accuracy type (correct, incorrect, abs<sub>outlier</sub>,
rel<sub>outlier</sub>) when performing the transform operation.
</p>
<p>
We'll change out relative outlier detection accordingly to the code below.
</p>



<pre class="example"># Maintain the original file order
data$FileOrder = seq(1,nrow(data))

# Calculate relative outliers by Subject and by ACC
data = ddply(data, .(Subject, Stimulus.ACC), transform, 
             high_cutoff = mean(Stimulus.RT) + 2.5*sd(Stimulus.RT),
             low_cutoff = mean(Stimulus.RT - 2.5*sd(Stimulus.RT)))

# Correct trials that are outside of the cutoffs defined above will be marked as 
# relatively outlying.

data$Stimulus.ACC[data$Stimulus.ACC=="correct" &amp; 
                    (data$Stimulus.RT &gt; data$high_cutoff | 
                       data$Stimulus.RT &lt; data$low_cutoff)]="rel_outliers"

# Reorder the dataset as it originally was.
data = data[order(data$FileOrder),]

<div id="outline-container-1.2.2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1.2.2"><span class="section-number-4">1.2.2</span> Summarizing our Simon Data </h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1.2.2">

<p>Now that we have marked outliers, two options exist to summarize the
data depending on how you want the output to look: <code>plyr</code> and
<code>reshape</code>.
</p>
<ul>
<li id="sec-1.2.2.1"><code>ddply()</code> <br/>
We can ply our data to get mean RTs by subject, by group, by
condition.



<pre class="example">summary = ddply(data[data$Stimulus.ACC=="correct",], 
.(Subject, Group, Congruency), summarise,
Mean.RT = mean(Stimulus.RT))

summary
</pre>




<p>
With <code>plyr</code>, it's relatively easy to go back and re-aggregate your data
by additional factors. For example, if we want to split our data by
block in the experiment, it's as easy as adding the blocking column to
our <code>ddply()</code> call.
</p>


<pre class="example">block_summary = ddply(data[data$Stimulus.ACC=="correct",], 
.(Subject, Group, Congruency, Running), summarise,
Mean.RT = mean(Stimulus.RT))

block_summary
</pre>




</li>
<li id="sec-1.2.2.2"><code>melt()</code> and <code>cast()</code> from the <code>reshape</code> package <br/>
The reshape package is great for getting your data to look just the
way you need it for various analyses. In addition to reshaping, it can
and will perform an aggregation function (e.g., mean) if
necessary. Reshape has two main functions, <code>melt()</code> and <code>cast()</code>. Melt
creates a "molten" data.frame. <code>cast()</code> takes a molten data.frame and
reshapes it to your specification.

<p>
When melting your data, <code>melt()</code> needs to know two things, first what
dataset you're melting. Second it needs to know either what your
measure variables of interest are (<code>measure.vars</code> ) or what your
identification variables are (<code>id.vars</code>). Measure variables are
typically those that you're planning to aggregate (i.e., dependent
variables). ID variables are essentially anything else. Typically it's
easiest to specify whichever variables you have the least of, because
<code>melt()</code> will assume that whatever is not specified will belong to the
other set of variables. For example, if you specify one measure
variable, everything else will be considered ID variables.
</p>
<p>
For our Simon data, let's specify just the one measure variable of
interest, RT. We can do separate melts for summary and for block
summary.
</p>


<pre class="example">summary_melt &lt;- melt(summary,  #we're going to melt down summary
                     measure.vars="Mean.RT") #our measure var is mean RT

blocksummary_melt &lt;- melt(block_summary, measure.vars="Mean.RT")
</pre>




<p>
Now let's cast our melted data. <code>cast()</code> expects three
arguments. First, it needs to know the name of the melted
dataset. Next, it wants to know how to reshape your data. Finally, it
needs an aggregation function (e.g., mean).
</p>
<p>
The reshape equation consists of two parts separated by ~. On the left side are,
generally, variables or factors that you want specified in each row of
a column. These are typically between-subjects factors if you're
thinking in the format of repeated measures ANOVA. For example, each
subject you may want listed on a separate row of a subject
column. Also, each subject belongs to only one group. Thus, subject
and group should fall to the left side of the equation. 
</p>
<p>
On the right side of the equation, you want to list factors or
variables which will be separated into measure columns. In the context
of repeated measures ANOVA, these are typically within subject
variables. So for the Simon data, we want each condition of the
congruency factor to be included in a column.  
</p>
<p>
Finally, you should specify some aggregation function, such as
mean. If you do not, <code>cast()</code> will just count the number of cells.
</p>



<pre class="example">summary_recasted &lt;- cast(summary_melt, #melted data to recast
                         Subject + Group ~ Congruency, mean) #the formula then the aggregation
</pre>




<p>
Let's say we also wanted to include block of the experiment in this
analysis as well. Each subject saw every block, so it's a repeated
factor and hence can be added to the right side of the cast equation.
</p>


<pre class="example">blocksummary_recasted &lt;- cast(blocksummary_melt, 
                              Subject+Group~Congruency+Running,mean)
</pre>




<p>
Now the really cool thing about melt/cast is that they can function on
your trial-level data and figure out the aggregation for you. So if
you're planning on aggregating and reshaping your data, <code>ddply()</code> is not
really necessary.
</p>



<pre class="example">#Melt our correct data with measure a variable of =Stimulus.RT=
data.melted &lt;- melt(data[data$Stimulus.ACC=="correct",],
     measure.vars="Stimulus.RT")

data.casted &lt;- cast(data.melted,
                         Subject + Group ~ Congruency, mean) #the formula then the aggregation
</pre>




<p>
Really easy right? It's also easy to include additional factors
here. Because we're working with melted trial level data, we don't
even have to re-melt anything like we did for the summary datasets. We
just add any factor to the equation in the appropriate place.
</p>



<pre class="example">data.casted &lt;- cast(data.melted,
                         Subject + Group ~ Running+ Congruency, mean) #the formula then the aggregation
